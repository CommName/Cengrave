Software created for controling homemade laser engraving machine.

While you are reviewing my code keep in mind that I am using this project to learn GitHub and OpenCV. Also, this is my first ever real project.

OpenCV
This project uses opencv 3.4.2 compiled with CMake and mingw32-make.
You will need to add OPENCV3_DIR environment variable that points to OpenCV folder.Also, add "%OPENCV3_DIR%\install\x86\mingw\bin" to the Path variable.
